# Predicting Diabetes and Insulin Levels with Machine Learning

## üìå Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict diabetes cases. We use **logistic regression** for classification and **linear regression** for insulin level prediction, investigating data structure, feature importance, and optimization techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying class imbalances
   - Analyzing correlations and inconsistencies in features
   - Understanding factors contributing to inconsistencies

2. **Logistic Regression for Classification** / **Linear Regression for Insulin Level Prediction**
   - Predicting diabetes cases / Insulin levels based on patient data
   - Experimenting with different **regularization methods** and **solvers**
   - Evaluating model performance
   - Analyzing feature importance
   - Identifying and removing **low-impact features**
   - Reducing **production costs** in real-world applications

## üìä Results & Insights
- Identified **key predictors** of diabetes.
- Showed how removing certain features can maintain performance while **simplifying the model**.
- Explored different solvers and regularization techniques for improved accuracy.
